Step 1: Open the git cmd 
Step 2: First navigate to the first git file only not the inner files. ex:cd gitlab
Step 3: Then do system configuration in the cmd box giving the user name and email
Step 4: Do global configuration giving the same then check git config --global --list to make sure your name comes up.
Step 5: Navigate to the folder you want to do the exp in ex: cd prg10
Step 6: Initialize the empty git repo using $git init
Step 7: Create a txt file and add it into the cmd box and commit it.
Step 8: Proceed to do three other changes in the file and do the respective three commits.
Step 9: Now we have a total of four commits but suppose I want to delete one of them, use $ git revert <commit id>
Step 10: This will revert that particular commit and create another commit for reverting the original commit.
Step 11: We did it!

Revert "the commit i will revert"

This reverts commit 6ec9930a1dbc705d834b37e06110e729fed933eb.
I just reverted the third commit.

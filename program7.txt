Step 1: Open the git cmd 
Step 2: First navigate to the first git file only not the inner files. ex:cd gitlab
Step 3: Then do system configuration in the cmd box giving the user name and email
Step 4: Do global configuration giving the same then check git config --global --list to make sure your name comes up.
Step 5: Navigate to the folder you want to do the exp in ex: cd prg7
Step 6: Initialize the empty git repo using $git init
Step 7: Create a remote repository and clone it into the desired folder.
Step 8: Then navigate to that remote repo's folder and then add that file and do a commit and save it.
Step 9: You can create multiple commits too, and choose which commit you want to add a tag to.
Step 10: give the cmd $git tag and this is to ensure that you don't have any other tags and if there are tags it will show up here.
Step 11: You can create a tag after a certain commit by using the cmd $git tag <tagname>
Step 12: Then again you can check the creation of the tag by using $git tag command.
Step 13: If you want to create a tag to a specific commit then we can do it by using $git tag <tagname> <commit id>
Step 14: Commit id of the commit can be obtained by the command $git log
Step 15: We did it!
